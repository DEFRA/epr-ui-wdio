Feature: Remove Compliance Scheme - Welsh Translation
    As a Welsh Organisation,
    I want to ensure that I can Add and Remove Compliance Schemes, using the Welsh language
    So I can submit packaging data

    Background: Open report data page
        Given init common scenario context
        And init Landing Pages scenario context
        And the registered user is on the "report data" page
        And the user logs in as a "Direct" Producer with "Approved" role
        And cookies "Accept" button should display
        And cookies are "Accepted"
        # Add Compliance Scheme
        When the user navigates to the add compliance scheme page
        When the user selects "Yes" on the add compliance scheme page
        And the user selects compliance scheme
        When the user confirms the compliance scheme option "change"
        Then the user should be on the "manage compliance scheme" page

    Scenario: What would you like to tell us about page
        When the user wants to change Compliance Scheme options
        Then the user should be on the "change compliance scheme" page
        And the "Welsh" toggle should be displayed
        When the user clicks the "Welsh" toggle
        Then the Welsh page H1 header should be correct for the "change compliance scheme" page
        # Remove Compliance Scheme
        And the registered user is on the "report data" page
        And the "English" toggle should be displayed
        When the user clicks the "English" toggle
        When the user removes the compliance scheme from the account
        Then the user should be on the "direct producer landing" page
        And the user signs out
